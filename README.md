## Hands-on Exercise #9
# React-Todo-List
Background
In the session, you have learned how to use React useState hook to perform state management in your React application. Moreover, you have learned how to handle form events and manage input states. In this hands-on exercise, you will get to create an offline to-do list, similar to what you did in Hands-on Exercise #5, but with React. The application should allow users to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete existing studies. In the end, you will become more familiar with state management and React.

# Tasks
- Initialize a new React project using vite and npm
- Install the dependencies and start the development server to preview your React application
- Create a form where users can enter new tasks and task lists where users can see existing tasks, similar to the image below
- Implement the following functionality
- Users can add new tasks
- Users can mark existing tasks as completed
- CHALLENGES: Users can delete existing tasks
